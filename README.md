## üéì Motivation & Background

This repository contains simulations of simple and double pendulum systems. Throughout our physics studies, professors often emphasized the importance of simple harmonic oscillators‚Äîone of the few problems every physicist should be able to solve analytically, without approximations.

During *Mechanics I*‚Äîa course I genuinely enjoyed‚Äîwe explored the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics, where:

$$
L = T - U
$$

By identifying the system's degrees of freedom and applying the Euler-Lagrange equations, we derived the differential equations of motion. Even in these seemingly simple systems, we began to uncover instability and chaotic behavior, especially in the double pendulum.

What‚Äôs fascinating is that from these basic principles, we can solve the motion equations analytically, numerically, or through approximation methods. This repository showcases those simulations and serves as both a learning tool and a demonstration of physical modeling.
