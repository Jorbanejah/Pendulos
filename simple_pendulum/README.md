# ðŸ§® Simple Pendulum Simulation

This module simulates the motion of a simple pendulum using numerical methods. It serves as a foundational example of classical mechanics and demonstrates how Lagrangian dynamics can be applied to derive and solve equations of motion.

## ðŸŽ“ Why the Simple Pendulum?

The simple pendulum is one of the few mechanical systems that every physicist should be able to solve analytically. Itâ€™s a classic example of a system governed by a second-order differential equation, and it introduces key concepts like:

- Harmonic motion
- Energy conservation
- Small-angle approximation
- Nonlinear dynamics (for larger angles)

In *Mechanics I*, we studied the Lagrangian formulation:

$$
L = T - U = \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 - mgl(1 - \\cos\\theta)
$$

From this, we derived the equation of motion using the Euler-Lagrange equation:

$$
\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\theta}} \\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 0
$$

This leads to the nonlinear differential equation:

$$
\\ddot{\\theta} + \\frac{g}{l} \\sin\\theta = 0
$$
